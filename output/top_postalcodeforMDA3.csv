Work to include the removal of the stair and landing on the west side yard and the storage shed at the rear.
Building will be fully sprinklered to NFPA 13 standard, and provided with a fire alarm.

Related to:
- AL402141 (Multi-Level Dwelling Unit Egress)
- AL402139 (Exposure to Exit Conditions)
- AL402142 ( Existing Spatial Separation Conditions)

The building is  sprinklered to NFPA13 (vs.NFPA13R). NFPA 13 was proposed as a mitigation feature to address Exposure to Exit conditions (AL402139), non-conforming spatial separation conditions( AL402142) and the muilti-level dwelling unit egress (AL402141).
All rooms, incl. batrooms and storages are to be sprinklered to NFPA 13.
Exit protection is provided by employing closed space fire sprinkles and tempered and laminated  safety glass provided with limit stops (<100mm) if operable. 
This is a rental building, and it has been upgraded to meet S2, F2 and A3 design upgrade levels as per VBBL 2007. In the future this existing building may be converted into strata property if the entire building is upgraded to design upgrade levels F4, S4, N4, A4  and E4, and it is subject to a separate Building Permit application.
An occupancy permit  and/or a final inspection for the dwelling will not be issued until such time as the Option/SRW agreement has been registered.
